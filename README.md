# NELMod
A mod for NeverEnding Legacy by Orteil made by AMwa1 and crazybot27. This mod adds a bunch of random stuff that shouldn't be in the game. It also impliments a bunch of already existing unimplimented features in the base game, such as science.
Use https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AMwa1/NELMod@master/tomfooleryV3-3.js to load the mod into NeverEnding Legacy.
